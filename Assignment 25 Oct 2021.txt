Q.1)-Difference b/w GitPull and GitFetch...??

GIT PULL:-
The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to
match that content once the content is downloaded git pull will enter a merge workflow. A merge commit will be created and head 
updated to point at the new commit.

GIT FETCH:-
The git fetch commamd downloads commits,files and references from a remote repository into your local repository. Fetching is what 
we want to see, what everybody else has been working on. When downloading content from a remote repository, git pull and git fetch 
commands are available to accomplish the task.

--> DEFFERENCE BETWEEN GIT PULL AND GIT FETCH :-

-The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and references from a remote repository into your local repository whereas git pull 
is the more aggressive alternative. Git Pull will download the remote content for the active local branch and immediately execute git 
merge to create a merge commit for the new remote content.

-When comparing Git Pull vs Git Fetch, Git Fetch is a safer alternative because it pulls in all the commits from your remote repository 
but does not make any changes to your local files. On the other hand, Git pull is faster as we are performing multiple actions in one.

**--comes after git fetch:-
git merge origin/master should work. Since master is usually a tracking branch, you could also do git pull from that branch and it will 
do a fetch & merge for you. If you have local changes on your master that aren't reflected on origin, you might want git rebase 
origin/master to make sure your commits are on top.

Q.2)- Difference b/w Git Merge and Rebase..??

--> Git Merge
-Git merge is a command that allows you to merge branches from git.
-Git merge adds a new commit preserving the  history.
-Git merge is familiar in use.
-Git merge maintains the content of the branch.

--> Git Rebase
-Git rebase is a command that allows developers to integrate changes from one branch to another.
-Git Rebase moves feature branch into the master.
-Git Rebase eliminates the unwanted history.
-Git Rebase is complex in use.
-Git Rebase cleans intermediate commits by making them a single commit.
